<p>Quantum physics, organic chemistry, and calculus are undoubtedly challenging subjects to learn. Asking questions? That's a piece of cake. Most of us have been doing that our whole lives. However, learning how to ask a good question might be one of the most underrated life skills. If we all learned exactly what it takes to ask a good question, we might start to see better results in whatever we strive to achieve. So, what does it require?<p>


<h5>Context</h5>
<p>When you first learn about programming, the first concept that is always hammered into your head is: <i>computers only know what you tell them</i>. While it might not seem obvious at first, this same idea should run through your head every time you ask an important question. Always assume that whoever will be answering your question knows absolutely nothing about it. For example, if you were to ask someone how to solve a very basic problem involving variable declaration in JavaScript, you would need to give that person some context. For example, 1) the time spent attempting this problem 2) your JavaScript skill level and 3) what the problem is specifically asking you to do. If the person answering the question knows this information, you will likely be provided with a more customized answer.</p>

<h5>Specificity</h5>
<p>In the Google+ community for DBC, I have noticed that other students will often get stuck on coding challenges. However, these students often fail to indicate <i>specifically</i> where they got stuck in the challenge. Was it in the pseudocode? The beginning of the challenge or the end? Vague questions will usually get you long-winded answers which often do not answer the real question you had in mind. When asking questions, be sure to state your purpose and what you specifically want to know. Providing context will allow the person to know where you are coming from; however, you also want to get directly to the point. This helps you avoid getting excess information you don't need, and you will also get your answer more efficiently.</p>

<h5>Honesty</h5>
<p>If your question has been answered, do not stop there. Was the answer sufficient? Do you have the answer you need? If not, think about how you might rephrase your question to get a better answer. There have been a few times when I have asked questions to my DBC peers in the Google+ community. It was not a 1 question to 1 answer ratio. Instead, it was a back and forth conversation between many different people which required me to be completely honest about what I was still specifically confused about. Often times, one response was not enough to get my question answered. It required the help of many people who all had different skill levels.</p>

<h5>Formatting</h5>
<p>This is an easy one to fix, but it is often ignored. How is your question formatted? This is usually most important if the question is asked in written form (like an online community). Good grammar and clear formatting can make it easier for others to fully understand your question. </p>

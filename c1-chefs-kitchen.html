<p>DBC is going to provide me with a very unique, unconventional learning experience. Unlike the traditional classroom setting where students play a passive role, DBC focuses on students working collaboratively in a positive learning environment. I believe I will thrive in this type of educational setting, and I am looking forward to working in a strong, close-knit team. Since my DBC peers will all come from different backgrounds, I know I will learn a great deal from every person I meet.</p>

<p>In addition, I know I can be honest when I'm feeling lost or doubtful about my learning abilities. DBC's environment encourages honesty and vulnerablility. By being truthful about my fears and insecurities, I can reach out and get help when I truly need it without feeling judged. This will accelerate my growth and learning.</p>

<p>As I make this pivotal career change, I am nervous, and I question my own abilities. However, I know that my feelings are shared by my peers at DBC. During my experience at DBC, I am going to push myself to levels I never thought possible. I am entering DBC ready to learn, and I am excited to work with incredible people!</p>

<p>It is a nice change to spend a moment thinking about the values that define who I am. The following are the seven values which I stand by:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>accomplishment</li>
<li>ambition</li>
<li>confidence</li>
<li>health</li>
<li>personal development</li>
<li>growth</li>
<li>commitment</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>When I think about my big, long-term goals, I always ask myself if they will harmonize with my personal values. If I have a job that compromises my health or leaves me feeling unambitious, I re-evaluate my life decisions. My values define who I am, and they guide my life choices.

<p>I think personal development is one of the most important values to me. The best part about personal development is that it only relies on one person: me. Whether it's making a commitment to go to the gym every day or writing a minimum of one blog entry a week, personal development is a direct investment in myself. My goals can be bold and ambitious or they can be small and effective. With personal development, the journey is usually the most rewarding part. Often times, I fixate on the end goal. However, I have noticed that the best part about making positive changes in my life are the vital life skills I learn such as commitment, time-management, and dedication.</p>

<p>The last time someone asked me for advice it was related to learning. My friend felt as though she was learning slower in comparison to the other students in her class. This question really stood out to me since I have noticed that this is a common insecurity that almost every person faces. In this case, I told her it was important to focus on two things: perspective and personal development. It is so easy to compare yourself to other people and rate your own value based off of where other people stand. However, we don't live in a world of uniformity (and that's a good thing!). Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. The most important thing to focus on is personal growth. Everyday you should strive to be better than you were yesterday.</p>

<p>After this reflection, I strongly believe that my personal values will help  mediate any stereotype threats I might face at DBC. I know there will be moments when I feel that I'm learning too slowly, asking the wrong questions, relying too much on others, and the list goes on. However, despite these overwhelming thoughts, I feel confident that the values I believe in will help me overcome the negative thoughts that hinder my progress.</p>

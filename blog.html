<p>DBC is going to provide me with a very unique, unconventional learning experience. Rather than the traditional classroom setting where students don't play an active role, DBC focuses on student interaction. I believe I will thrive in this learning environment. I am looking forward to working in a strong, close-knit team. Despite the fact that everyone in my cohort will come from different backgrounds, I know that I can learn a great deal from every single person.</p>

<p>In addition, I know I can be honest when I'm feeling lost or anxious about my learning abilities. This environment ecnourages being humble and vulnerable. Instead of putting on a facade, I feel like I can be my true self. By being vulnerable in this learning environment, I can get help when I truly need it without feeling judged or inferior to others. This is going to help accelerate my growth and learning.</p>

<p>As I make this big career change, I am certainly nervous, and I question my own abilities. However, I know that my feelings are shared by many other people at DBC. During my experience at DBC, I am going to push myself to levels I never thought possible. I am completely ready to enter DBC hungry and ready to learn, and I am excited to work with incredible people!</p>

<p>CSS positioning properties allow you to properly position different elements on your webpage. There are four positioning properties: <b>absolute, relative, static, and fixed.</b></p>

<h5>Static Positioning</h5>
<p>Static is the default position value for an element. The element will be positioned according to the normal flow of the webpage. Static elements cannot be moved according to the "right", "left","top", or "bottom" properties. In the images below, Block 2 sits within Block 1. Since no positioning is specified, the images are automatically "static".</p>

<h5>Relative Positioning</h5>

<p>Relative positioning allows an element to be positioned relative to its original position. If an element has a relative position, it can move according to the "right", "left","top", or "bottom" properties. The HTML for this example shows that Block 1 moves 200px to the left of its original position while Block 2 moves 500px to the left of its original position.</p>

<h5>Absolute Positioning</h5>
<p>
Absolute positioning allows an element to be positioned according to the specified location. When an element has a position of absolute, it will be moved relative to the next parent element that has a position of "relative" or "absolute". If such a parent element does not exist, the element will be positoned relative to the <html> element (the webpage). In addition, the element will not affect or be affected by the positioning of other elements. Elements that have a position of absolute do not follow the normal flow of the webpage. In the example below, Block 2 is positioned relative to its parent element, Block 1, which is set to the position absolute. Furthermore, Block 1 is positioned relative to the webpage.

<h5>Fixed Positioning</h5>
<p>Elements that are set to a fixed position are placed relative to the browser. As you scroll down the page, the element will not move from its position. Elements that have a position of fixed do not follow the normal flow of the webpage. In the example below, Block 1 and Block 2 are both fixed to the webpage, and they are positioned relative to the webpage.</p>

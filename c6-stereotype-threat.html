<h1 id="Heading">Stereotype Threat</h1>

<p>Negative stereotypes are so commonplace that we often overlook their significant impact on society. Psychologist Dr. Claude Steele was interested in understanding why African-American students who came from middle class families and received high SAT scores were underperforming in college in comparison to their white counterparts. His extensive research highlighted what is known as the stereotype threat. The African-American students in his research studies were deeply affected by the negative stereotype that blacks are racially inferior and incapable of succeeding academically. As a result of these invalid beliefs, these extremely bright students were not performing at the expected level. Their overwhelming fear of validating the stereotype that has plagued their community caused them incredible anxiety and shame. </p>

<p>There have countless times in my life where I positvely believed I was incapable of doing something. For instance, when I ran cross-country in middle school, I told myself I would never be as fast as someone who had been training longer than me. I even convinced myself that because I was shorter than most of the girls on the team, I would never become a star athlete. In addition, when I struggled with calculus in high school, I convinced myself that I would never succeed at a job that required logic and math skills. On the other hand, I always enjoyed science, and I consistently performed well in my chemistry and biology classes. I typically scored well on writing assigments and tests as well. I often attributed my writing success to the fact that I was female and knew how to express myself more easily.</p>

<p> As a result of these life experiences, I quickly created my identity. I was a science nerd who was decent (not great) at writing. I was also someone who would never be very athletic or excel at math. These were my labels, and I stuck to them. They literally defined me, and there was no way they would change. I seized any opportunity I had to validate my identity. Since I labled myself as someone who exceled in my science classes, I typically put in more effort for those classes, and I had greater confidence in myself. In contrast, fitness was never designed to be my area of expertise. If I collapsed after doing a push-up, I confirmed my belief that I was not a fit, athletic person.</p>

<p>It's really hard to break your identity. Because when that happens, you suddenly have to question who you are. It makes you face your deepest fears. Suddenly, you realize maybe you are capable of achieving more than you thought possible. While it is a discomforting feeling, it is also incredibly liberating. You are not defined by what anybody tells you. You can be whoever you want. For me, this is a learning process. I still hold on to a lot of irrational beliefs that limit my abilities. However, I am also learning to vindicate some of the invalid ideas that I held as the solid truth for so many years. I can proudly say I can do more than one push-up (yay!), and I'm pursuing a career that requires logical thinking. Once I let go of who I think I am supposed to be, I can finally be myself.<p>

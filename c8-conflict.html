Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to cope with it.</blockquote><p id="smallquote"><i>Dorothy Thomas</i></p>

  <p>Conflicts are inevitable. Regardless of the cause of the dispute, the key to finding harmony is learning how to appropriately handle your emotions. Dealing with conflict in a peaceful manner requires active communication, vulnerability, and managing emotions. It is extremely important to learn how to handle conflicts, especially in the workplace because teams that work in harmony are usually happier and more productive.</p>

  <p>When I moved away to college, I experienced a conflict which caused a whirlwind of negative emotions. I had made it my mission to find the perfect spot in the library to study. After surveying a number of different floors, I found a gem on the fourth floor. The desk I claimed faced a large window where sunlight poured in everyday. I soon realized I was not the only person who had marked her territory in the library. Another student had chosen a desk right next to mine. This initially presented no problems for me. That changed quickly.</p>

  <p>As a music aficionado, I am very well aware of music etiquette. You cannot force other people to listen to your music, especially in a library, which is a designated quiet zone. Unfortunately, this student preferred not to use headphones during her study sessions. Although she made an admirable effort to keep the volume low, it was still incredibly distracting. When she switched from music to YouTube videos of the <i>Colbert Report</i>, I had to say something. Initially, I tapped her shoulder and politely said "Excuse me, if you don't mind, would you mind wearing headphones while you work? Thank you." She happily obliged. I was happy. The issue had been solved. For that day at least.</p>

  <p>The next time she came to the library, the headphones were nowhere to be found. This continued for weeks. I was flabbergasted. Did she forget about the conversation we had? Or was she just selfish and spiteful? Despite my looks of annoyance, distracting sounds continued to emanate from her laptop. I noticed that no one else seemed to mind. This concerned me, and I started to think that I was overreacting. After another week, I simply could not take it anymore. I marched up to her and told her "Excuse me, this is my second time asking you to put your headphones in. It's very distracting, and I can't do my work." The difference this second time was my impolite tone. I was curt, and I was visibly upset. She put her headphones in for the day. However, she never came back to study in that area again.</p>

  <p>Although the conflict I experienced was inisignifcant in the large scheme of things, it was still an important learning experience. During this conflict, I noticed that I was very assumptive. When this student continued to listen to music without headphones despite my request, I became angry because I felt that she had simply ignored our conversation. I felt disrespected. However, she might have been a forgetful person who was simply unaware of her surroundings. Her intentions were not to spite me. Since I avoided the second confrontation for weeks, my annoyance escalated. Eventually, when we had our second encounter, I had so much pent up anger that I couldn't converse with her in a rational way. My rude tone probably turned her off, and she likely moved to a different part of the library. Looking back, I should have approached her sooner and used a nicer tone. The next time I experience a conflict, I will spend more time thinking about how I can properly convey my feelings to someone else.

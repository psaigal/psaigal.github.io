<p>Week 3 at DBC is coming to an end! It has been a challenging and rewarding experience so far. While working through a number of challenges, I discovered the importance of understanding my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to learning. After taking Anthony Gregorc's quiz on personal thinking styles, I learned that my thinking style is <b>concrete sequential</b>.The table below provides a description of my thinking style.</p>

<p>There are many advantages to having a concrete sequential learning style. My affinity for order and structure enable me to be more productive and efficiently complete tasks. In addition, my logical, practical thinking style allow me to make smart, calculated decisions based on facts. Furthermore, my thinking style helps me avoid the problems associated with procrastination and lack of planning.
  <p>On the other hand, a concrete sequential learning style also has its drawbacks. For example, I struggle when working in groups with unpredictable people. In addition, I find it extremely challenging to work on projects that have no specific directions. It is difficult for me to think abstractly, and I often feel like I lack creativity.</p>
<p>One of my biggest struggles at DBC has been my frustration with not being able to grasp new concepts immediately. Despite all of my planning, I find that it often takes me longer than expected to complete certain assignments. This is partially due to the fact that I expect myself to be an expert when I am still a beginner. I become fixated on trying to learn every detail and perfect every assignment. These struggles are all related in some way to my learning style. My comfort zone is predictability and order. When I suddenly find that I don't have full control over a situation, I feel uncomfortable and lose confidence in myself.
  <p>It is extremely important for me to remind myself that I am still learning, and I need to set realstic goals for myself. I cannot predict the amount of time it will take me to learn a new concept by simply creating a schedule or planning ahead of time. I will not always have clear, specific instructions on what I need to do. In addition, I need to get accustomed to working with different types of people. If a team member does not work in a linear, structured manner, it does not mean that their thinking style is inadequate or inferior. That is the beauty of working in a team. Every person has different strengths that help contribute to the creation of a strong, collaborative team.
  <p>After reading about fixed vs. growth mindset, I evaluated my own talents and shortcomings. I fully understand how a growth mindset will help me thrive at DBC. It is never easy to be a beginner. Learning a new, challenging skill will force me to become aware of my weaknesses. Adopting a growth mindset will allow me to turn my struggles into challenges to improve myself.</p>
